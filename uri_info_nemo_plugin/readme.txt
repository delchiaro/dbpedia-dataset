to use the plugin, you have to change the working directory string in the "uri_info.nemo_action" file:

 /YOUR/PATH/TO/PROJECT/dbpedia-dataset

Then you can put the file in:

 ~/.local/share/nemo/actions

Now you can right click a fodler of the dataset and run the uri_info script (restart nemo before?).
